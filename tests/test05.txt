Left to right: Falcon 9 v1.0, v1.1, v1.2 "Full Thrust", Falcon 9 Block 5, Falcon Heavy, and Falcon Heavy Block 5.
Since June 2010, rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 149 times, with 147 full mission successes, one partial failure and one total loss of the spacecraft. In addition, one rocket and its payload were destroyed on the launch pad during the fueling process before a static fire test was set to occur.

Designed and operated by private manufacturer SpaceX, the Falcon 9 rocket family includes the retired versions Falcon 9 v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2 "Full Thrust" Block 1 to 4, along with the currently active Block 5 evolution. Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift derivative of Falcon 9, combining a strengthened central core with two Falcon 9 first stages as the side boosters.[1]

The Falcon design features reusable first-stage boosters, which land either on a ground pad near the launch site or on a drone ship at sea.[2] In December 2015, Falcon 9 became the first rocket to land propulsively after delivering a payload into orbit.[3] This reusability has resulted in significantly reduced launch costs.[4] Falcon family core boosters have successfully landed 112 times in 123 attempts. A total of 29 boosters have flown multiple missions, with a record of twelve missions by the same booster.

Falcon 9's typical missions include cargo delivery and crewed flights to the International Space Station (ISS) with the Dragon and Dragon 2 capsules, launch of communications satellites and Earth observation satellites to geostationary transfer orbits (GTO), and low Earth orbits (LEO), some of them at a polar inclination. The heaviest payload launched to a LEO are a batch of 53 Starlink satellites weighing a total 16,250 kg (35,830 lb) to a 300 km (190 mi) orbit on 18 March 2022.[5] The heaviest payload launched to a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) was Intelsat 35e with 6,761 kg (14,905 lb).[a] Launches to higher orbits have included the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) probe to the Sun–Earth Lagrange point L1, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space telescope on a lunar flyby trajectory, the Falcon Heavy test flight which launched Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster into a heliocentric orbit extending beyond the orbit of Mars, and Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) into the minor-planet moon Dimorphos of the double asteroid Didymos.

Launch statistics
Rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 149 times over 12 years, resulting in 147 full mission successes (98.66%), one partial success (SpaceX CRS-1 delivered its cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), but a secondary payload was stranded in a lower-than-planned orbit), and one full failure (the SpaceX CRS-7 spacecraft was lost in flight in an explosion). Additionally, one rocket and its payload Amos-6 were destroyed before launch in preparation for an on-pad static fire test.

The first rocket version Falcon 9 v1.0 was launched five times from June 2010 to March 2013, its successor Falcon 9 v1.1 15 times from September 2013 to January 2016, and the latest upgrade Falcon 9 Full Thrust 126 times from December 2015 to present. The Falcon Heavy has been launched 3 times. Its first flight was in February 2018, incorporating two refurbished first stages as side boosters, and then again in April and June 2019, the June 2019 flight reusing the side booster from the previous flight. The final "Falcon 9 Block 4" booster to be produced was flown in April 2018, and the first Falcon 9 Block 5 version in May 2018. While Block 4 boosters were only flown twice and required several months of refurbishment, Block 5 versions are designed to sustain 10 flights with just some inspections.[6] A total of 89 re-flights of first stage boosters have all successfully launched their payloads.

The rocket's first-stage boosters landed successfully in 112 of 123 attempts (91.1%), with 88 out of 93 (94.6%) for the Falcon 9 Block 5 version.

Success[9]	Failure[9][14]
(parachute)
Maiden flight of SpaceX's Dragon capsule, consisting of over 3 hours of testing thruster maneuvering and then reentry.[15] Attempted to recover the first stage by parachuting it into the ocean, but it disintegrated upon reentry, again before the parachutes were deployed.[12] (more details below) It also included two CubeSats,[16] and a wheel of Brouère cheese. Before the launch, SpaceX discovered that there was a crack in the nozzle of the 2nd stage's Merlin vacuum engine. So Elon just had them cut off the end of the nozzle with a pair of shears and launched the rocket a few days later. After SpaceX had trimmed the nozzle, NASA was notified of the change and they agreed to it.[17]

Orbcomm-OG2[24]	172 kg (379 lb)[25]	LEO	Orbcomm	Partial failure[26]
CRS-1 was successful, but the secondary payload was inserted into an abnormally low orbit and subsequently lost. This was due to one of the nine Merlin engines shutting down during the launch, and NASA declining a second reignition, as per ISS visiting vehicle safety rules, the primary payload owner is contractually allowed to decline a second reignition. NASA stated that this was because SpaceX could not guarantee a high enough likelihood of the second stage completing the second burn successfully which was required to avoid any risk of secondary payload's collision with the ISS.[27][28][29]

SLC-4E	CASSIOPE[23][32]	500 kg (1,100 lb)	Polar orbit LEO	MDA	Success[31]	Uncontrolled
(ocean)[d]
First commercial mission with a private customer, first launch from Vandenberg, and demonstration flight of Falcon 9 v1.1 with an improved 13-tonne to LEO capacity.[30] After separation from the second stage carrying Canadian commercial and scientific satellites, the first stage booster performed a controlled reentry,[33] and an ocean touchdown test for the first time. This provided good test data, even though the booster started rolling as it neared the ocean, leading to the shutdown of the central engine as the roll depleted it of fuel, resulting in a hard impact with the ocean.[31] This was the first known attempt of a rocket engine being lit to perform a supersonic retro propulsion, and allowed SpaceX to enter a public-private partnership with NASA and its Mars entry, descent, and landing technologies research projects.[34] (more details below)

[44]
The Thai communication satellite was the second GTO launch for Falcon 9. The USAF evaluated launch data from this flight as part of a separate certification program for SpaceX to qualify to fly military payloads, but found that the launch had "unacceptable fuel reserves at engine cutoff of the stage 2 second burnoff".[45] Thaicom-6 was inserted into a Super-Synchronous Transfer Orbit of 90,039 km (55,948 mi) in apogee with an inclination of 22.46° to the equator.

(Dragon C105)	2,296 kg (5,062 lb)[46] (excl. Dragon mass)	LEO (ISS)	NASA (CRS)	Success	Controlled
(ocean) [d][47]
Following second-stage separation, SpaceX conducted a second controlled-descent test of the discarded booster vehicle and achieved the first successful controlled ocean touchdown of a liquid-rocket-engine orbital booster.[48][49] Following the soft touchdown, the first stage tipped over as expected and was destroyed. This was the first Falcon 9 booster to fly with extensible landing legs and the first Dragon mission with the Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle. This flight also launched the ELaNa 5 mission for NASA as a secondary payload.[50][51]
10	14 July 2014,

LC-40	Orbcomm-OG2-1
(6 satellites)[23]	1,316 kg (2,901 lb)	LEO	Orbcomm	Success[52]	Controlled
(ocean)[d][47]
Payload included six satellites weighing 172 kg (379 lb) each and two 142 kg (313 lb) mass simulators.[25][53] Equipped for the second time with landing legs, the first-stage booster successfully conducted a controlled-descent test consisting of a burn for deceleration from hypersonic velocity in the upper atmosphere, a reentry burn, and a final landing burn before soft-landing on the ocean surface.[54]
11	5 August 2014,

LC-40	AsiaSat 8[23][55][56]	4,535 kg (9,998 lb)	GTO	AsiaSat	Success[57]	No attempt
[58]
First time SpaceX managed a launch site turnaround between two flights of under a month (22 days). GTO launch of the large communication satellite from Hong Kong did not allow for propulsive return-over-water and controlled splashdown of the first stage.[58]

Following second-stage separation, SpaceX attempted to return the first stage for the first time to a 90 m × 50 m (300 ft × 160 ft) floating platform — called the autonomous spaceport drone ship. The test achieved many objectives and returned a large amount of data, but the grid-fin control surfaces used for the first time for more precise reentry positioning ran out of hydraulic fluid for its control system a minute before landing, resulting in a landing crash.[72]

Launch performance was nominal until an overpressure incident in the second-stage LOX tank, leading to vehicle breakup at T+150 seconds. Dragon capsule survived the explosion but was lost upon splashdown as its software did not contain provisions for parachute deployment on launch vehicle failure.[97](more details below) The drone ship Of Course I Still Love You was towed out to sea to prepare for a landing test so this mission was its first operational assignment.[98]

First attempt to land from a ballistic trajectory using a single-engine landing burn, as all previous landings from a ballistic trajectory had fired three engines on the final burn. The latter provides more braking force but subjects the vehicle to greater structural stresses, while the single-engine landing burn takes more time and fuel while allowing more time during final descent for corrections.[146]

The rocket and the Amos-6 payload were lost in a launch pad explosion on 1 September 2016 during propellant filling procedures prior to a static fire test.[149] The pad was clear of personnel, and there were no injuries.[150] SpaceX released an official statement in January 2017 indicating that the cause of the failure was a buckled liner in several of the Composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) (used to store helium which pressurize the stage's propellant tanks), causing perforations that allowed liquid and/or solid oxygen to accumulate underneath the lining, which was ignited by friction.[151] Following the explosion, SpaceX has switched to performing static fire tests only without attached payloads.(more details below)
2017
With 18 launches throughout 2017, SpaceX had the most prolific yearly launch manifest of all rocket families.[152] Five launches in 2017 used pre-flown boosters.

Return-to-flight mission after the loss of Amos-6 in September 2016. This was the first launch of a series of Iridium NEXT satellites intended to replace the original Iridium constellation launched in the late 1990s. Each Falcon 9 mission carried 10 satellites, with a goal of 66 plus 9 spare[157] satellites constellation by mid-2018.[158][159] Following the delayed launch of the first two Iridium units with a Dnepr rocket from April 2016, Iridium Communications decided to launch the first batch of 10 satellites with SpaceX instead.[160] Payload comprised ten satellites weighing 860 kg (1,900 lb) each plus a 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) dispenser.[161]

Maiden flight of Falcon Heavy, using two recovered Falcon 9 cores as side boosters (from the Thaicom 8[258] and SpaceX CRS-9[131] missions), as well as a modified Block 3 booster reinforced to endure the additional load from the two side boosters. The static fire test, held on 24 January 2018, was the first time 27 engines were tested together.[259] The launch was a success, and the side boosters landed simultaneously at adjacent ground pads.[257] Drone ship landing of the central core failed due to TEA–TEB chemical igniter running out, preventing two of its engines from restarting; the landing failure caused damage to the nearby drone ship.[260][261] Final burn to heliocentric Earth-Mars orbit was performed after the second stage and payload cruised for 6 hours through the Van Allen radiation belts.[262] Later, Elon Musk tweeted that the third burn was successful,[263] and JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System showed the second stage and payload in an orbit with an aphelion of 1.67 AU.[264] The live webcast proved immensely popular, as it became the second most watched livestream so far on YouTube, reaching over 2.3 million concurrent views.[265] Over 100,000 visitors are believed to have come to the Space Coast to watch the launch in person.[266](more details below)

First CRS mission with the Falcon 9 Block 5. This carried the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar (GEDI) as an external payload.[384] The mission was delayed by one day due to moldy rodent food for one of the experiments on the Space Station. A previously flown Dragon spacecraft was used for the mission. The booster, in use for the first time, experienced a grid fin hydraulic pump stall on reentry, which caused it to spin out of control and touchdown at sea, heavily damaging the interstage section; this was the first failed landing targeted for a ground pad.[383][385]

2019
Shotwell stated in May 2019 that SpaceX might conduct up to 21 launches in 2019, not counting Starlink missions.[394] With a slump in worldwide commercial launch contracts for 2019, SpaceX ended up launching only 13 launch vehicles throughout 2019 (11 without Starlink), significantly fewer than in 2017 and 2018, and third most launches of vehicle class behind China's Long March and Russia's R-7 launch vehicles.[395]

Nusantara Satu is a private Indonesian comsat planned to be located at 146.0° east,[400] with a launch mass of 4,100 kg (9,000 lb),[403] and featuring electric propulsion for orbit-raising and station-keeping.[404][405] S5, a 60-kg smallsat by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), was piggybacked on Nusantara Satu, and was deployed near its GEO position to perform a classified space situational awareness mission. This launch opportunity was brokered by Spaceflight Industries as "GTO-1".[402]
The Beresheet Moon lander (initially called Sparrow) was one of the candidates for the Google Lunar X-Prize, whose developers SpaceIL had secured a launch contract with Spaceflight Industries in October 2015.[406] Its launch mass was 585 kg (1,290 lb) including fuel.[407] After separating into a supersynchronous transfer orbit[408] with an apogee of 69,400 km (43,100 mi),[409][407] Beresheet raised its orbit by its own power over two months and flew to the Moon.[408][410] After successfully getting into lunar orbit, Beresheet attempted to land on the Moon on 11 April 2019 but failed.[411]

First flight of the SpaceX Crew Dragon. This was the first demonstration flight for the NASA Commercial Crew Program which awarded SpaceX a contract in September 2014 with flights hoped as early as 2015.[416] The Dragon performed an autonomous docking to the ISS 27 hours after launch with the hatch being opened roughly 2 hours later.[417] The vehicle spent nearly a week docked to the ISS to test critical functions. It undocked roughly a week later on 8 March 2019 and splashed down six hours later at 13:45.[418] The Dragon used on this flight was scheduled to fly on the inflight abort test in mid-2019 but was destroyed during testing.[419] The booster B1051.1 replaced B1050[420] and flew again on 12 June 2019.

Second flight of Falcon Heavy, the first commercial flight, and the first one using Block 5 boosters. SpaceX successfully landed the side boosters at Landing Zone 1 and LZ 2 and reused the side boosters later for the STP-2 mission. The central core landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, located 967 km (601 mi) downrange, the furthest successful sea landing so far.[425] Despite the successful landing, due to rough seas and the fact that the Octagrabber had not been configured to grab the central core of a Falcon Heavy, the central core was unable to be secured to the deck for recovery and later tipped overboard in transit. SpaceX has since developed new attachment fixtures for the Octagrabber so this problem won't happen again.[426][427] SpaceX recovered the fairing from this launch and later reused it in the November 2019 Starlink launch.[428][429] Arabsat-6A, a 6,465 kg (14,253 lb) Saudi satellite, is the most advanced commercial communications satellite so far built by Lockheed Martin.[430] The Falcon Heavy delivered the Arabsat-6A into a supersynchronous transfer orbit with 90,000 km (56,000 mi) apogee with an inclination of 23.0° to the equator.[431]

A trio of satellites built for Canada's RADARSAT program were launched that plan to replace the aging Radarsat-1 and Radarsat-2. The new satellites contain Automated Identification System (AIS) for locating ships and provide the world's most advanced, comprehensive method of maintaining Arctic sovereignty, conducting coastal surveillance, and ensuring maritime security.[444][443] The mission was originally scheduled to lift off in February but due to the landing failure of booster B1050, this flight was switched to B1051 (used on Crew Dragon Demo-1) and delayed to allow refurbishment and transport to the West coast.[420] The booster landed safely through fog.[445] A payload cost of roughly US$1 billion made this SpaceX's second most expensive payload launched[446][447] and most valuable commercial payload so far put into orbit.[448]

USAF Space Test Program Flight 2 (STP-2)[75] carried 24 small satellites,[450] including: FormoSat-7 A/B/C/D/E/F integrated using EELV Secondary Payload Adapter,[451] DSX, Prox-1[452] GPIM,[453] DSAC,[454] ISAT, SET,[455] COSMIC-2, Oculus-ASR, OBT, NPSat,[456] and several CubeSats including E-TBEx,[457] LightSail 2,[458] TEPCE, PSAT, and three ELaNa 15 CubeSats. Total payload mass was 3,700 kg (8,200 lb).[459] The mission lasted six hours during which the second stage ignited four times and went into different orbits to deploy satellites including a "propulsive passivation maneuver".[456][460]
Third flight of Falcon Heavy. The side boosters from the Arabsat-6A mission just 2.5 months before were reused on this flight and successfully returned to LZ-1 and LZ-2.[420] The center core, in use for the first time, underwent the most energetic reentry attempted by SpaceX, and attempted a landing over 1,200 km (750 mi) downrange, 30% further than any previous landing.[461] This core suffered a thrust vector control failure in the center engine caused by a breach in the engine bay due to the extreme heat. The core thus failed its landing attempt on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You due to lack of control when the outer engines shut down.[462] For the first time, one fairing half was successfully landed on the catch-net of the support ship GO Ms. Tree (formerly Mr. Steven).[463]

This launch carried nearly 9,000 individual unique payloads including over one ton of science experiments, the most so far launched on a SpaceX Dragon. The third International Docking Adapter (IDA-3), a replacement for the first IDA lost during the CRS-7 launch anomaly, was one of the external payloads on this mission.[466] Along with food and science, the Dragon also carried the ELaNa 27 RFTSat CubeSat[467] and MakerSat-1 which will be used to demonstrate microgravity additive manufacturing. The satellite is expected to be launched by a Cygnus dispenser later in July 2019.
The booster used on this flight was the same used on CRS-17 earlier in the year; originally, it was planned to reuse it again for the CRS-19 mission later this year,[468] but the plan was scrapped. For the first time, the twice flown Dragon spacecraft also made a third flight.[469] Also used for the first time was a gray-band painted where the RP-1 kerosene tank is located, to help with thermal conductivity and thus saving fuel during long coasts.[470]

AMOS-17 is the most advanced high-throughput satellite to provide satellite communication services to Africa.[475] Following the loss of AMOS-6 in September 2016, Spacecom was granted a free launch in compensation for the lost satellite.[476] Due to the free launch, Spacecom was able to expend the booster with no extra cost that comes with expending a booster, and thus could reach final orbit quicker. This booster became the second Block 5 booster to be expended.[474][477] For the second time, Ms. Tree managed to catch a fairing half directly into its net.[478]

Also on board were upgrades for the Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL). Onboard experiments include the testing of the spread of fire in space, mating barley in microgravity and experiments to test muscle and bone growth in microgravity.[485] Secondary payloads include the Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI), an experiment to image high resolution across all colours of the light spectrum, allowing for imaging of soil, rocks, vegetation, snow, ice and man-made objects. Additionally, there were three CubeSats from NASA's ELaNa 28 mission,[381] including the AztechSat-1 satellite built by students in Mexico.[485]

This was the third Falcon 9 launch for JSAT and the previous two were in 2016. SpaceX successfully landed B1056.3 but both fairing halves missed the recovery boats Ms. Tree and Ms. Chief.[489]
2020
In late 2019, Gwynne Shotwell stated that SpaceX hoped for as many as 24 launches for Starlink satellites in 2020,[490] in addition to 14 or 15 non-Starlink launches. At 26 launches, 13 of which for Starlink satellites, Falcon 9 had its most prolific year, and Falcon rockets were second most prolific rocket family of 2020, only behind China's Long March rocket family.[491]

Launched the largest, high-power broadcasting satellite for SiriusXM's digital audio radio service (DARS). SXM-7 was built by Maxar Technologies; intended to operate in the S-band spectrum, it will replace the SXM-3 satellite. The satellite will deliver the highest power density of any commercial satellite on-orbit,[598] generate more than 20 kW of power, and have a large unfoldable antenna reflector, which enables broadcast to radios without the need for large dish-type antennas on the ground. Due to the heavy weight, the payload was injected into a sub-synchronous orbit of 224 km × 19,411 km (139 mi × 12,061 mi) and the satellite itself will transfer to full GTO.[599] It was the first time a commercial primary payload flew on a booster which had been flown more than 4 times before.[600] First dedicated customer launch where the fairings were previously used.[601]

A hole in a heat-shielding engine cover, which likely developed through fatigue, allowed recirculating hot exhaust gases to damage one of the Merlin 1D first-stage engines, causing it to shut down early during ascent. Engine-out capability of the Falcon 9 allowed the mission to continue and successfully deploy the 60 Starlink satellites to orbit.[630] The issue caused the booster to fail its landing attempt and miss the droneship Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY) after its entry burn, breaking the longest streak of 24 landing successes (since surpassed).[631] During this mission, GO Ms. Tree and GO Ms. Chief were used for the last time to recover the fairings;[632][633] SpaceX retired the fairing catching program in favor of fairing fishing.[634] Both fairing catching ships were retired from SpaceX use.

Launch of Falcon 9 Flight 1 with a boilerplate Dragon
On 4 June 2010, the first Falcon 9 launch successfully placed a test payload into the intended orbit.[11] Starting at the moment of liftoff, the booster experienced roll.[937] The roll stopped before the craft reached the top of the tower, but the second stage began to roll near the end of its burn,[11] tumbling out of control during the passivation process and creating a gaseous halo of vented propellant that could be seen from all of Eastern Australia, raising UFO concerns.[938][939]

COTS demonstration flights
Main articles: COTS Demo Flight 1 and Dragon C2+

COTS-1 Dragon after return from orbit
Second launch of Falcon 9 was COTS Demo Flight 1, which placed an operational Dragon capsule in a roughly 300 km (190 mi) orbit on 8 December 2010,[940] The capsule re-entered the atmosphere after two orbits, allowing testing for the pressure vessel integrity, attitude control using the Draco thrusters, telemetry, guidance, navigation, control systems, and the PICA-X heat shield, and intended to test the parachutes at speed. The capsule was recovered off the coast of Mexico[941] and then placed on display at SpaceX headquarters.[942]

The remaining objectives of the NASA COTS qualification program were combined into a single Dragon C2+ mission,[943] on the condition that all milestones would be validated in space before berthing Dragon to the ISS. The Dragon capsule was propelled to orbit on 22 May, and for the next days tested its positioning system, solar panels, grapple fixture, proximity navigation sensors, and its rendezvous capabilities at safe distances. After a final hold position at 9 m (30 ft) away from the Harmony docking port on 25 May, it was grabbed with the station's robotic arm (Canadarm2), and eventually, the hatch was opened on 26 May. It was released on 31 May and successfully completed all the return procedures,[944] and the recovered Dragon C2+ capsule is now on display at Kennedy Space Center.[945] Falcon 9 and Dragon thus became the first fully commercially developed launcher to deliver a payload to the International Space Station, paving the way for SpaceX and NASA to sign the first Commercial Resupply Services agreement for 12 cargo deliveries.[946]

CRS-1
Main article: SpaceX CRS-1

Dragon CRS-1 berthed to the International Space Station (ISS) on 14 October 2012, photographed from the Cupola.
First operational cargo resupply mission to ISS, the fourth flight of Falcon 9, was launched on 7 October 2012. At 76 seconds after liftoff, engine 1 of the first stage suffered a loss of pressure which caused an automatic shutdown of that engine, but the remaining eight first-stage engines continued to burn and the Dragon capsule reached orbit successfully and thus demonstrated the rocket's "engine out" capability in flight.[947][948] Due to ISS visiting vehicle safety rules, at NASA's request, the secondary payload Orbcomm-2 was released into a lower-than-intended orbit.[27] The mission continued to rendezvous and berth the Dragon capsule with the ISS where the ISS crew unloaded its payload and reloaded the spacecraft with cargo for return to Earth.[949] Despite the incident, Orbcomm said they gathered useful test data from the mission and planned to send more satellites via SpaceX,[26] which happened in July 2014 and December 2015.

Maiden flight of v1.1
Main article: CASSIOPE
File:SpaceX Falcon 9 Cassiope Launch 29 Sep 2013.webm
SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 launch from Vandenberg with CASSIOPE
Following unsuccessful attempts at recovering the first stage with parachutes, SpaceX upgraded to much larger first stage booster and with greater thrust, termed Falcon 9 v1.1 (also termed Block 2[950]). SpaceX performed its first, demonstration flight of this version on 29 September 2013,[951] with CASSIOPE as a primary payload. This had a payload mass that is very small relative to the rocket's capability, and was launched at a discounted rate, approximately 20% of the normal published price.[952][953][31] After the second stage separation, SpaceX conducted a novel high-altitude, high-velocity flight test, wherein the booster attempted to reenter the lower atmosphere in a controlled manner and decelerate to a simulated over-water landing.[31]

Loss of CRS-7 mission
Main article: SpaceX CRS-7

SpaceX CRS-7 disintegrating two minutes after liftoff, as seen from a NASA tracking camera.
On 28 June 2015, Falcon 9 Flight 19 carried a Dragon capsule on the seventh Commercial Resupply Services mission to the ISS. The second stage disintegrated due to an internal helium tank failure while the first stage was still burning normally. This was the first (and only as of February 2022) primary mission loss for any Falcon 9 rocket.[95] In addition to ISS consumables and experiments, this mission carried the first International Docking Adapter (IDA-1), whose loss delayed preparedness of the station's US Orbital Segment (USOS) for future crewed missions.[954]

Performance was nominal until T+140 seconds into launch when a cloud of white vapor appeared, followed by rapid loss of second-stage LOX tank pressure. The booster continued on its trajectory until complete vehicle breakup at T+150 seconds. The Dragon capsule was ejected from the disintegrating rocket and continued transmitting data until impact with the ocean. SpaceX officials stated that the capsule could have been recovered if the parachutes had deployed; however, the Dragon software did not include any provisions for parachute deployment in this situation.[97] Subsequent investigations traced the cause of the accident to the failure of a strut that secured a helium bottle inside the second-stage LOX tank. With the helium pressurization system integrity breached, excess helium quickly flooded the tank, eventually causing it to burst from overpressure.[955][956] NASA's independent accident investigation into the loss of SpaceX CRS-7 found that the failure of the strut which led to the breakup of the Falcon-9 represented a design error. Specifically, that industrial grade stainless steel had been used in a critical load path under cryogenic conditions and flight conditions, without additional part screening, and without regard to manufacturer recommendations.[957]

Full-thrust version and first booster landings
Main articles: Falcon 9 flight 20 and SpaceX CRS-8

Falcon 9 Flight 20 historic first-stage landing at CCAFS Landing Zone 1, 22 December 2015
After pausing launches for months, SpaceX launched on 22 December 2015, the highly anticipated return-to-flight mission after the loss of CRS-7. This launch inaugurated a new Falcon 9 Full Thrust version (also initially termed Block 3[950]) of its flagship rocket featuring increased performance, notably thanks to subcooling of the propellants. After launching a constellation of 11 Orbcomm-OG2 second-generation satellites,[958] the first stage performed a controlled-descent and landing test for the eighth time, SpaceX attempted to land the booster on land for the first time. It managed to return the first stage successfully to the Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral, marking the first successful recovery of a rocket first stage that launched a payload to orbit.[959] After recovery, the first stage booster performed further ground tests and then was put on permanent display outside SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California.[100]

On 8 April 2016, SpaceX delivered its commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station marking the return-to-flight of the Dragon capsule, after the loss of CRS-7. After separation, the first-stage booster slowed itself with a boostback maneuver, re-entered the atmosphere, executed an automated controlled descent and landed vertically onto the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, marking the first successful landing of a rocket on a ship at sea.[960] This was the fourth attempt to land on a drone ship, as part of the company's experimental controlled-descent and landing tests.[961]

Loss of Amos-6 on the launch pad
Main article: Amos-6
On 1 September 2016, the 29th Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launchpad while propellant was being loaded for a routine pre-launch static fire test. The payload, Israeli satellite Amos-6, partly commissioned by Facebook, was destroyed with the launcher.[962] On 2 January 2017, SpaceX released an official statement indicating that the cause of the failure was a buckled liner in several of the COPV tanks, causing perforations that allowed liquid and/or solid oxygen to accumulate underneath the COPVs carbon strands, which were subsequently ignited possibly due to friction of breaking strands.[151]

Inaugural reuse of the first stage
Main article: SES-10
On March 30, 2017, Flight 32 launched the SES-10 satellite with the first-stage booster B1021, which had been previously used for the CRS-8 mission a year earlier. The stage was successfully recovered a second time and was retired and put on display at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.[963]

Zuma launch controversy
Main article: Zuma (satellite)
Zuma was a classified United States government satellite and was developed and built by Northrop Grumman at an estimated cost of US$3.5 billion.[964] Its launch, originally planned for mid-November 2017, was postponed to 8 January 2018 as fairing tests for another SpaceX customer were assessed. Following a successful Falcon 9 launch, the first-stage booster landed at LZ-1.[243] Unconfirmed reports suggested that the Zuma spacecraft was lost,[244] with claims that either the payload failed following orbital release, or that the customer-provided adapter failed to release the satellite from the upper stage, while other claims argued that Zuma was in orbit and operating covertly.[244] SpaceX's COO Gwynne Shotwell stated that their Falcon 9 "did everything correctly" and that "Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false".[244] A preliminary report indicated that the payload adapter, modified by Northrop Grumman after purchasing it from a subcontractor, failed to separate the satellite from the second stage under the zero gravity conditions.[965][964] Due to the classified nature of the mission, no further official information is expected.[244]

Falcon Heavy test flight
Main article: Falcon Heavy test flight

The maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy occurred on February 6, 2018, marking the launch of the most powerful rocket since the Space Shuttle, with a theoretical payload capacity to low Earth orbit more than double the Delta IV Heavy.[966][967] Both side boosters landed nearly simultaneously after a ten-minute flight. The central core failed to land on a floating platform at sea.[261] The rocket carried a car and a mannequin to an eccentric heliocentric orbit that reaches further than aphelion of Mars.[968]

Maiden flight Crew Dragon and first crewed flight
Main articles: Crew Dragon Demo-1 and Crew Dragon Demo-2
On March 2, 2019, SpaceX launched its first orbital flight of Dragon 2 (Crew Dragon). It was an uncrewed mission to the International Space Station. The Dragon contained a mannequin named Ripley which was equipped with multiple sensors to gather data about how a human would feel during the flight. Along with the mannequin was 300 pounds of cargo of food and other supplies.[969] Also on board was Earth plush toy referred to as a 'Super high tech zero-g indicator'.[970] The toy became a hit with astronaut Anne McClain who showed the plushy on the ISS each day[971] and also deciding to keep it on board to experience the crewed SpX-DM2.

The Dragon spent six days in space including five docked to the International Space Station. During the time, various systems were tested to make sure the vehicle was ready for US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to fly in it in 2020. The Dragon undocked and performed a re-entry burn before splashing down on March 8, 2019, at 08:45 EST, 320 km (200 mi) off the coast of Florida.[972]

SpaceX held a successful launch of the first commercial orbital human space flight on May 30, 2020, crewed with NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken. Both astronauts focused on conducting tests on the Crew Dragon capsule. Crew Dragon successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico on August 2, 2020.[973]

Booster reflight records
Main articles: Falcon 9 B1046, Falcon 9 B1048, and List of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters
Most records were set during launches of Starlink satellites.

On 3 December 2018, Spaceflight SSO-A launched on B1046. It was the first commercial mission to use a booster flying for the third time.

B1048 was the first booster to be recovered four times on 11 November 2019, and the first to perform a fifth flight on 18 March 2020, but the booster was lost during re-entry.

B1049 was the first booster to be recovered five times on 4 June 2020, six times on 18 August 2020, and seven times on 25 November 2020.

B1051 became the first booster to be recovered eight times on 20 January 2021, nine times on 14 March 2021, and ten times on 9 May 2021, achieving one of SpaceX's milestone goals for reuse. It then became the first booster to be recovered eleven times on 18 December 2021, and twelve times on 19 March 2022. [974] [975] [976] [977]

Booster B1060 holds the record for fastest turnaround at 27 days. It launched on 7 January and again on 4 February 2021. [978][979]

Notes
 The Telstar 18V and Telstar 19V satellites were heavier, but were launched into a lower-energy transfer orbit achieving an apogee well below the geostationary altitude.
 Falcon 9 first-stage boosters are designated with a construction serial number and an optional flight number when reused, e.g. B1021.1 and B1021.2 represent the two flights of booster B1021. Launches using reused boosters are denoted with a recycled symbol ♺.
 Dragon 1 or 2 are designated with a construction serial number or name and an optional flight number when reused, e.g. Dragon C106.1 and Dragon C106.2 represent the two flights of Dragon C106. Dragon spacecraft that are reused are denoted with a recycled symbol ♺.
 A controlled "ocean landing" denotes a controlled atmospheric entry, descent and vertical splashdown on the ocean's surface at near zero velocity, for the sole purpose of gathering test data; such boosters were destroyed at sea.
 Since it was a pre-flight test, SpaceX does not count this scheduled attempt in their launch totals. Some sources do consider this planned flight into the counting schemes, and as a result, some sources might list launch totals after 2016 with one additional launch.

 Payload comprises five Iridium satellites weighing 860 kg each,[325] two GRACE-FO satellites weighing 580 kg each,[326] plus a 1000 kg dispenser.[161]
 Total payload mass includes the Crew Dragon capsule, fuel, suited mannequin, instrumentation and 204 kg of cargo.
 Despite making a successful landing, de-tanking and heading back home, the stage tipped over at sea. This is still considered a successful landing as the stage damage occurred while in transport.[424]
 Many Transporter payloads are not public, or don't have a publicly revealed mass. SpaceX has not published a payload mass estimate for this mission.
 After landing, de-tanking and heading back home, the stage and Octagrabber were damaged in heavy seas. This is still considered a successful landing as the stage damage occurred while in transport. It is not yet clear whether the booster will fly again.[741]

Orbcomm requested that SpaceX carry one of their small satellites (weighing a few hundred pounds, versus Dragon at over 12,000 pounds)... The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station. It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit. SpaceX would not have agreed to fly their satellite otherwise, since this was not part of the core mission and there was a known, material risk of no altitude raise.
