A two-way player will provide services primarily to the team's G League affiliate, but can spend up to 45 days with the parent NBA team. Only players with four or fewer years of NBA experience are able to sign two-way contracts, which can be for either one season or two. Players entering training camp for a team have a chance to convert their training camp deal into a two-way contract if they prove themselves worthy enough for it. Teams also have the option to convert a two-way contract into a regular, minimum-salary NBA contract, at which point the player becomes a regular member of the parent NBA team. Two-way players are not eligible for NBA playoff rosters, so a team must convert any two-way players it wants to use in the playoffs, waiving another player in the process.During the 2021–22 season, two-way deals will work a little differently than usual. Rather than being limited to spending 45 days with their NBA teams, two-way players would be eligible to be active for up to 50 of their team's 82 NBA games. And instead of having their salaries by how many days they spend in the NBA, they'll be paid a flat salary equal to 50% of the minimum player salary applicable to a player with zero years of service.[597]Denotes players who were promoted to the main roster****	Denotes players who were cut before season's endPlayer	Date signed	Team	School / Club team	RefJoël Ayayi****	August 3	Los Angeles Lakers	Gonzaga(Undrafted in 2021)	[598]Nate Hinton**** (RFA)	Dallas Mavericks(Previously on a two-way contract)	[599]Arnoldas Kulboka	Charlotte Hornets	RETAbet Bilbao Basket(Spain)	[600]Scottie Lewis	FloridaAustin Reaves	Los Angeles Lakers	Oklahoma(Undrafted in 2021)	[598]Trendon Watford	Portland Trail Blazers	LSU(Undrafted in 2021)	[601]Sandro Mamukelashvili	August 4	Milwaukee Bucks	Seton Hall	[602]Sharife Cooper	August 5	Atlanta Hawks	Auburn	[603]Duane Washington Jr.	Indiana Pacers	Ohio State(Undrafted in 2021)	[161]Nathan Knight	August 6	Minnesota Timberwolves	Atlanta Hawks(Previously on a two-way contract)	[604]McKinley Wright IV	Colorado(Undrafted in 2021)	[604]Justin Champagnie	August 7	Toronto Raptors	Pittsburgh(Undrafted in 2021)	[205]Jarrell Brantley**** (RFA)	August 8	Utah Jazz(Previously on a two-way contract)	[605]Aaron Henry****	Philadelphia 76ers	Michigan State(Undrafted in 2021)	[606]Neemias Queta	Sacramento Kings	Utah State	[607]Jericho Sims	New York Knicks	Texas	[608]Rayjon Tucker**** (RFA)	Philadelphia 76ers(Previously on a two-way contract)	[606]David Johnson	August 9	Toronto Raptors	Louisville	[609]Trent Forrest (RFA)	August 11	Utah Jazz(Previously on a two-way contract)	[610]Ignas Brazdeikis	August 12	Orlando Magic	[611]Killian Tillie (RFA)	Memphis Grizzlies(Previously on a two-way contract)	[612]Sam Hauser	August 13	Boston Celtics	Virginia(Undrafted in 2021)	[613]Matthew Hurt****	Houston Rockets	Duke(Undrafted in 2021)	[614]Eugene Omoruyi****	Dallas Mavericks	Oregon(Undrafted in 2021)	[615]Chris Chiozza	August 14	Golden State Warriors	Brooklyn Nets(Previously on a two-way contract)	[616]Markus Howard (RFA)	August 15	Denver Nuggets(Previously on a two-way contract)	[617]Aaron Wiggins	Oklahoma City Thunder	Maryland	[618]Kessler Edwards	August 16	Brooklyn Nets	Pepperdine	[619]Luka Garza	August 17	Detroit Pistons	Iowa	[620]Chris Smith	UCLA(Undrafted in 2021)Josh Hall**** (RFA)	August 18	Oklahoma City Thunder(Previously on a two-way contract)	[621]Jose Alvarado	August 19	New Orleans Pelicans	Georgia Tech(Undrafted in 2021)	[622]Devon Dotson**** (RFA)	Chicago Bulls(Previously on a two-way contract)	[254]Daulton Hommes****	New Orleans Pelicans	Vanoli Cremona(Italy)	[622]Cassius Winston (RFA)	Washington Wizards(Previously on a two-way contract)	[623]DeJon Jarreau****	August 24	Indiana Pacers	Houston(Undrafted in 2021)	[624]Skylar Mays (RFA)	August 26	Atlanta Hawks(Previously on a two-way contract)	[625]Grant Riller****	August 30	Philadelphia 76ers	Charlotte Hornets(Previously on a two-way contract)	[626]Marcus Garrett****	September 2	Miami Heat	Kansas(Undrafted in 2021)	[627]JaQuori McLaughlin****	September 4	Dallas Mavericks	UC Santa Barbara(Undrafted in 2021)	[628]Anthony Lamb**** (RFA)	September 6	Houston Rockets(Previously on a two-way contract)	[629]Chandler Hutchison****	September 7	Phoenix Suns	San Antonio Spurs(Waived on September 4)	[630]Joe Wieskamp	San Antonio Spurs	Iowa	[631]Caleb Martin	September 14	Miami Heat	Charlotte Hornets(Waived on August 7)	[632]Justin Robinson****	September 15	Milwaukee Bucks	Oklahoma City Thunder(10-day contract expired on April 25)	[633]Brodric Thomas**** (RFA)	Cleveland Cavaliers(Previously on a two-way contract)	[634]Paul Watson****	Oklahoma City Thunder	Toronto Raptors(Waived on August 3)	[635]Petr Cornelie****	September 17	Denver Nuggets	Élan Béarnais(France)	[636]Justin James****	September 22	Utah Jazz	Sacramento Kings(Waived on August 15)	[637]Keljin Blevins	September 23	Portland Trail Blazers(Previously on a two-way contract)	[295]Yves Pons	Memphis Grizzlies	[294]Jamorko Pickett	September 24	Detroit Pistons	Georgetown(Undrafted in 2021)	[638]Tyler Bey****	September 26	Houston Rockets(Waived on September 17)	[639]Amir Coffey (RFA)	September 27	Los Angeles Clippers(Previously on a two-way contract)	[307]Sekou Doumbouya****	October 12	Los Angeles Lakers	Houston Rockets(Waived on October 7)	[640]Daishen Nix	October 15	Houston Rockets	[641]David Duke Jr.	October 16	Brooklyn Nets	[642]Tacko Fall****	Cleveland Cavaliers	[643]Malik Fitts****	Utah Jazz	[644]RJ Nembhard	Cleveland Cavaliers	[643]Luka Šamanić****	New York Knicks	San Antonio Spurs(Waived on October 11)	[645]Joël Ayayi****	October 17	Washington Wizards	[374]Devontae Cacok	October 18	San Antonio Spurs	[376]Tyler Cook	Chicago Bulls	[646]Jeff Dowtin****	Golden State Warriors	[377]Jay Huff****	Los Angeles Lakers	Washington Wizards(Waived on October 13)	[647]Garrison Mathews	Houston Rockets	[378][379]Brodric Thomas	Boston Celtics	Cleveland Cavaliers(Waived on October 12;
