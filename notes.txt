Huffman:

runtime:
O(nlogn)

LZ77:

runtime:
O(nlogn)



Speaker 1 Theo: Christophesies Graph algorithm
set up graph in report, tell him every requirement for the Graph
Just use a consisten E for the runtime

Speaker 2 Charlei Thao: sudoku algorithm
Back tracking algorithm, brute force

Speaker 3 Saotatpio: red black trees
Good history lession on the algorithm
tree maintains balance based on boolean inside nodes
well done with the induction proof of the runtime
mention default color of nodes

Speaker 5: At K-nearest neightbor
got intuition
clearify that we are finding the k nearest neightbor for new datapoints
mention runtime O(nlogn)

Jared:
Gives two version of the solution recursion(brute force) and dynamic
mention runtime of the two versions and how it compares
well done giving the base cases for the intuition
edge cases?
What if u were to use a dictionary instead of a matrix for the dynamic approach
